## Story


In the year 2032, the world as we knew it has disappeared. Two years ago, a virus was discovered, initially starting as a small infection. Over time, it mutated, transforming people into hideous, monster-like beings, as if straight out of a horror movie.

**LEFV**, one of the last surviving soldiers, finds himself in a tough situation. His entire team has fallen, and he is alone, vulnerable to the dangers around him. His mission is to gather supplies and reach the rescue helicopter.
